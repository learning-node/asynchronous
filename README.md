Asynchronous JavaScript

For the homework (all challenges and instructions are in `main.js`), you will need to uncomment the line at the end of the challenge and use it to test your work. I recommend that after you solve a challenge, comment out that line again so that when you attempt subsequent challenges, the console output only shows console logs from the problem you are working on. That will prevent confusing console output.
